## Task 2: Development Proposal Instructions

Write a short, formal, and informative development proposal for the following project:

- Private dashboard showing the health status of the 9 machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories for which they collect telemetry.
- Access to the page happens only within the client's intranet.
- Authentication is synced to an internal authentication server (users can leverage their company-wide accounts).
- The dashboard consists of a single page listing the current status of all monitored devices.
- The view is collapsible/expandable at the factory and device levels (showing a history of statuses).

### What to include (please take a look at the document template)

1. Overview
   - An intro to the proposal and a high-level description of the project.
2. Scope
   - Describe the functionality of the project.
   - Reference the graphics included in the template.
3. Estimate
   - A total man-hour estimate + breakdown for development, testing, and integration.
4. Timeline
   - List the milestones of the project.
5. Support
   - Let the client know they can rely on continuous product support (e.g. bug fixes, support tickets, new functionality).

### Tools and Resources

- For this task, you will need some word-processing software. MS Office works if you have that, but you can also use free software like Libre Office (find a link in the Resources).
- Please find a template for your proposal document in the Resources.
- It is a good idea to keep the document as long as it is in the template (in terms of the number of pages).
